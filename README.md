Kanye Lyrics Analysis Project
Welcome to the Kanye Lyrics Analysis Project! ðŸŽ¤ This project is all about diving into the lyrical genius of Kanye West and uncovering the stories behind his iconic verses.

Project Overview
    Data Exploration
    Raw Data: Find the untouched lyrics straight from the API in the data/raw/ directory
    Processed Data: Cleaned and polished lyrics reside in data/processed/

Notebooks
    exploratory_analysis.ipynb: Initial exploration of the lyrical landscape
    data_preprocessing.ipynb: Cleaning and shaping the data for analysis
    feature_engineering.ipynb: Crafting features to reveal hidden insights

Source Code
    src/: 
        data_collection.py: Script for pulling data from the API
        data_preprocessing.py: Script for cleaning and processing
        feature_engineering.py: Script for crafting features
        modeling.py: Script for generating lyrics
        	Using TensorFlow and Keras, it learns the patterns and
        	 from Kanye's lyrics. It breaks down the lyrics into bite-sized pieces, creating a model that can understand the flow
        	 **It's like having a virtual Kanye collaborator**
